            <h2>What Are Bumblebees?</h2>
            <p>
                Bumblebees are fuzzy, round insects that belong to the genus Bombus. They are one of the most recognizable types of bees, 
                thanks to their plump bodies and colorful stripes, which often combine black, yellow, and sometimes orange or white. 
                Unlike honeybees, which are sleek and efficient-looking, bumblebees appear softer and more approachable, with a gentle 
                hum as they move from flower to flower. Their fur, technically called setae, not only gives them their signature cute 
                appearance but also plays a critical role in collecting and transferring pollen as they feed on nectar.
            </p>
            <h2>The Gentle Nature of Bumblebees</h2>
            <p>
                Despite their size and audible buzz, bumblebees are surprisingly docile. Unlike more defensive insects, 
                they rarely sting unless they feel genuinely threatened. This calm nature makes them safe to observe, even up close, 
                as they busy themselves collecting nectar and pollen. Watching a bumblebee work is a reminder of nature’s intricate 
                balance and the quiet resilience of even the smallest creatures.

            <h2>Why Are Bumblebees So Cute?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Round and Chubby Appearance: </b>Bumblebees have a compact, almost pudgy shape that makes them look like little flying teddy bears.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fuzzy Coats: </b>Their soft fur helps them collect pollen and gives them an endearing, huggable look (though not recommended!). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Clumsy Flight: </b>Despite their relatively large size, bumblebees are agile fliers. Their slightly awkward movements and audible buzz add to their charm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Gentle Demeanor: </b>Bumblebees are not as aggressive as some other bees. They’re calm and focused, often uninterested in humans unless provoked.
                </li>
